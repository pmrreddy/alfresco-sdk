Introduction

  The Alfresco AMP Archetype is a sample fully featured project to manage AMP (Alfresco Module Package) projects. 
  This archetype can be used for Alfresco Repository. For Share, please refer to the {{{../share-amp-archetype/index.html}Share AMP archetype}}

* Features
  
  Amongst other features, this archetype provides support for:
  
  * <<<amp>>> packaging support for your projects
  
  * AMP dependency management in Maven
  
  * Installation of AMPs in an Alfresco WAR
  
  * AMP Unit Testing support. Just run the standard <<<mvn test>>> and see your <<<src/test/java>>> Alfresco unit tests run. 
    An sample Unit Test is provided in this archetype. 
  
  * Embedded run in Tomcat and embedded H2 database for demo purposes, rapid application development and integration testing 
  (<<NOTE>>: this is not a {{{http://www.alfresco.com/services/subscription/supported-platforms/} supported stack}} so use <<only for development purposes>>)

  * Support for (remote) Junit and integration testing and rapid development (using spring-loaded, see run.sh)
  
  * Seamless IDE integration with Eclipse and Idea

How to create a project:

  As of version 2.0-beta-3, you can create a project with the latest released archetype with the following command directly from Maven Central:
  
+---+
mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-amp-archetype
+---+
  
  For previous versions, you need to use the Alfresco Artifacts repository:
  
+---+
mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=org.alfresco.maven.archetype:alfresco-amp-archetype -DarchetypeCatalog=https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/groups/public/archetype-catalog.xml
+---+
  
  You should then:
  
  [[1]] Select the <<<alfresco-amp-archetype>>> version
  
  [[2]] Specify the <<<groupId>>> and <<<artifactId>>> for the project you want to create
  
  [[3]] (<Optionally>) Select Alfresco Version / Edition (current default is: Alfresco Community 4.2.c)
  
 You can find new Alfresco AMP project ready to go in the <<<artifactId>>> folder.
 
Quickstart

   Once your project is created:
   
   * Enter the project folder and run <<<./run.sh>>> (you might need to <<<chmod u+x run.sh>>> to make it executable). 
     This will setup the SDK and the Alfresco repository (not Share or Solr).  
    
   * Wait for the startup of the webapp and then go <<<http://localhost:8080/alfresco>>>.
  
   * Import the project in your favorite IDE (with Maven integration) and start developing right away.
