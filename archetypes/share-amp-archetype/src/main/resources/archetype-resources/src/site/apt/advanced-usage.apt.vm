AMP Unit Testing

    Unit test your AMP customization is as easy as adding your tests in <<<src/test/java>>>. The current module in development
    will be added to the test classpath together with all necessary Alfresco Spring contexts.
    
    Running <<<mvn test>>> will results in your unit tests to be run. You can skip this (<<<not recommended>>>) 
    adding <<<-DskipTests>>> to your command line.

Share AMP Archetype properties

    In the AMP archetype (as in the whole Part of the Alfresco SDK\x99) properties are configurable at many levels:
    
    * as POM properties
    
    * direclty in *.properties, particularly
        
        * <<<src/main/amp/module.properties>>> (filtered and packaged in the AMP)
        
        * <<<src/test/properties/<env>/alfresco-global.properties>>> (environment dependent properties for WAR run embedded)

* Common properties

    Archetype behavior can mostly be controlled directly in the POM, via common properties provided by the parent POM.
    See {{{../../poms/alfresco-sdk-parent/sdk-properties.html} SDK properties reference}} for details.
    
    
* AMP specific properties

    In addition to the common properties, the following properties are specific of the AMP archetype. You can change
    these properties to select a different WAR to install your AMP to (e.g. a pre-customized Alfresco or Share instance):
    
+---+
<project>
    ...
    <properties>
        <!--
        Determines the coordinates of target WAR for this AMP
        Allowed values: alfresco (default) | share
        -->
        <alfresco.client.war>alfresco</alfresco.client.war>
        <alfresco.client.war.groupId>${alfresco.groupId}</alfresco.client.war.groupId>
        <alfresco.client.war.version>${alfresco.version}</alfresco.client.war.version>
    </properties>
    ...
</project>

Parent POM and behavior customization 

    To customize the behavior of your project, check out full set of the properties and plugin configurations defined in the 
    {{{../../poms/alfresco-sdk-parent/index.html}single entry point parent POM}}.
    
    One quick way to do that is to use the <<<maven-help-plugin:effective-pom>>> to analyze your POM at runtime.
