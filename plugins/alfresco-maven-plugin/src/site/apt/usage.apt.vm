How to use this plugin?

  There are fundamentally 3 methods to use this plugin:
  
  [[1]] Using Archetypes provided in the Alfresco SDK
    
  [[2]] By using the Alfresco SDK Parent POM
  
  [[3]] Via direct configuration in your POM
  
* Method 1 - Using Alfresco SDK Archetypes

  Two sample archetypes already use the plugin and provide best practice example on how to use it:
  
  [[1]] The {{{../../archetypes/alfresco-amp-archetype/index.html} Alfresco AMP Archetype}} provides a sample of AMP packaging
  
  [[2]] The {{{../../archetypes/alfresco-allinone-archetype/index.html} Alfresco All-in-One Archetype}} provides a sample using AMPs as dependencies and WAR overlay
  
  
 This is the <<recommended>> and less error-prone way of using the plugin.
 
* Method 2 - Using Alfresco SDK Parent POM

  The {{{../../poms/alfresco-sdk-parent/index.html}Alfresco SDK Parent POM}} provides a single entry point for all SDK features.
  
  By using it as parent as follows:
  
+---+
<project>
     ...
     <parent>
        <groupId>org.alfresco.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>alfresco-sdk-parent</artifactId>
        <version>1.0</version>
    </parent>
    ...
</project>
+---+

  you will have automatic support for AMP packaging of your project (just add you sources in <<<src/main/amp>>>).
  
* Method 3 - Direct configuration in POM

   If you want more control over the plugin behavior you can use it directly in your POM.
   
   <<NOTE>>: The following configuration is not required when using the SDK parent, as it's already included there.  
   
   In order to manage AMP artifacts with the Maven Alfresco plugin you need to:
   
   * Declare the plugin in your POM with <<<<extensions>>>> enabled, to allow AMP packaging lifecycle:
      
+---+
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
          <groupId>org.alfresco.maven.plugin</groupId>
          <artifactId>alfresco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>${project.version}</version>
          <extensions>true</extensions>
        </plugin>
        ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
  [...]
</project>
+---+

  * If you want to package an Alfresco Module Package from your <<<amp>>> packaging project you also need to make sure
  your AMP content gets copied to <<<\${project.build.directory}/\${project.build.finalName}>>> so the plugin can pick them up.
  Supposing your AMP sources are in <<<src/main/amp>>> you should configure the following <<<<resource>>>> block:
  
+---+
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    <resources>
        ...
        <resource>
            <directory>src/main/amp</directory>
            <!-- This is relative to \${project.build.outputDirectory} -->
            <targetPath>../\${project.build.finalName}</targetPath>
            <filtering>${app.filtering.enabled}</filtering>
        </resource>
    </resources>
  </build>
  [...]
</project>
+---+
